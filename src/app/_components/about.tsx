                Hi, ive been studying web development for the
                past year, im gonna update this by the way but,
                Creativity is my paddion, i try to implement the act of creation
                into my daily life. I like crocheting blankets just 
                as much as i like weaving components. Coming from Minnesota,
                i like to make things i can use, just like the functionality,
                i provide with websites, i like to do the same with the things i make.
